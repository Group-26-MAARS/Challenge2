# Challenge 2: Maintenance 

The purpose of challenge 2 is to demonstrate the usability of Augmented Reality (AR) for routine maintenance tasks. United Launch Alliance has thousands of support equipment items that need the be routinely serviced, tested and replace. The use of AR could potentially streamline the process for the engineers and the technicians who work on equipment.

The user will be able to point their device in the direction of equipment items and will be given valuable information about the current status of the item. A Hologram will be displayed that will convey that information. For Challenge 2 the equipment item will be represented by plants. The service that will be performed will be watering.  The user will be able to walk into an area with plants and point their device at the plants. Each plant will have a unique QR code that will identify the plant itself and its service plan. Bases on that service plan the plants status will be displayed. The statuses include Red: Overdue, Orange: Due, Yellow: Coming due and Green: Satisfied. Each plant will need to be watered over certain intervals of time. When the user completes the service, they will indicate they have done so by clicking a button. This will allow the application to update the status of that plant accordingly

<br />
Further iterations of Challenge 2 would allow plans to be much more elaborate and customizable by both the engineers and technicians. The engineers could make, for example, a test plan for a new equipment item based on a time interval, number of uses and visual cue (with the use of a network). The application will recognize that item and display the correct status based on that testing plan to technicians. I imagine this could be expanded even further to display the test plan for the technician to follow or potentially launching Challenge 1: Procedure Generation when the item is due for testing where they could follow the procedures and relay that information back to Challenge 2 to update the status.
